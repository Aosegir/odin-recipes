            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Wrap hash browns in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. Stir together hash browns, melted butter, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Press about 1/4 cup of the hash brown mixture into bottom and up the sides of each prepared muffin cup.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir together cheese, eggs, bell pepper, and crushed red pepper (if using) in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove muffin tin from the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Top hash browns with half of the bacon. Top with egg mixture and remaining bacon. Bake until a knife inserted into centers comes out clean, 13 to 15 minutes. Garnish with chives.</li>
